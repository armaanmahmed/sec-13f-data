# SEC Form 13-F Historical Data
This contains form 13-F data as filed with the SEC. It was downloaded from the [SEC's publicly available datasets](https://www.sec.gov/data-research/sec-markets-data/form-13f-data-sets).  
However, rather than manually downloading each quarter's dataset from the website, you can download them here in bulk.

## Current dates covered
2013 Q2 - 2023 Q4

## Dependencies
The repository uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) to store the datasets.  

To install on Linux, run the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

## Usage
You may benefit from running `git lfs clone` instead of `git clone` to speed up the download process. Due to the size of the files, it will likely take a few minutes.
